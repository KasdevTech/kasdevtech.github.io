#### Azure Network Reference Architectures

By now, you've learned about VNets, peering, firewalls, DNS, and more.  
Let’s bring it all together with real Azure networking architectures you can **apply in production**.


#### Design Pattern 1: Hub-Spoke with VPN Gateway

Perfect for hybrid connectivity and centralized control.

#### Key Features:
- Central **Hub VNet** with:
  - VPN Gateway
  - Azure Firewall or NVA
  - DDoS Protection
- Multiple **Spoke VNets** for apps/environments
- VNet Peering for traffic

#### Diagram:

```
             [On-Premises]
                  |
        ====== Site-to-Site VPN ======
                  |
          +------------------+
          |    Hub VNet      |
          |  VPN + Firewall  |
          +------------------+
            /      |       \
           /       |        \
     [Spoke A] [Spoke B] [Spoke C]
```

#### Design Pattern 2: Private Link + NAT Gateway

For **secure outbound** and **fully private access** to PaaS.

#### Key Features:
- No public IPs exposed
- Access services using **Private Endpoint**
- Use **NAT Gateway** for consistent outbound traffic

#### Use Case:
- Enterprises with strict compliance
- Apps accessing databases, storage privately



#### Design Pattern 3: Global Architecture with ExpressRoute

For companies operating across multiple geographies.

#### Key Features:
- Global VNet Peering
- Multiple regions connected via ExpressRoute
- Central NVA / Firewall clusters in each region



#### Architecture Best Practices

| Area               | Best Practice                                       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| IP Addressing      | Plan for non-overlapping CIDRs across VNets         |
| Peering            | Use transitive routing via hub (no full mesh)       |
| DNS                | Use Private DNS zones for Private Endpoints         |
| Outbound Access    | Use NAT Gateway (not Load Balancer SNAT)            |
| Security           | Layered: NSG → ASG → Azure Firewall → DDoS          |
| Cost               | Share infra in hub (VPN, DNS, Firewall)             |
