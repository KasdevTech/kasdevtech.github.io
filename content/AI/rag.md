Generative AI is powerful—but what if your model needs **real-time**, **domain-specific**, or **private data**? That’s where **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** comes in.



#### What is RAG?

**RAG** stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It's a technique that enhances a language model’s response by **retrieving relevant documents** from a knowledge base and **injecting them into the prompt**.

 Think of it as “chat with memory or custom knowledge.”



#### How RAG Works (Simplified)

1. **User asks a question**
2. System **retrieves** relevant context (documents) from a vector database (like ChromaDB or Pinecone)
3. Retrieved context is **combined** with the user’s question
4. The **language model** (like GPT-4o) generates a response using this combined input



#### Example: Build a RAG App with FastAPI + OpenAI + ChromaDB

Let’s walk through an architecture example of a **chatbot that answers questions from your company docs**.

#### Tech Stack

- OpenAI GPT-4o
- ChromaDB (vector store)
- LangChain (optional for pipeline)
- FastAPI (backend)
- React (frontend)

#### Example Flow

```
User Question → FastAPI Endpoint → Search in ChromaDB → Top K Chunks → Prompt GPT-4 → Response → Frontend
```
