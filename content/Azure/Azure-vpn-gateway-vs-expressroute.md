####  Azure VPN Gateway vs ExpressRoute – What Should You Use?

Now that we understand VNets and peering, let’s talk about **how to connect your on-premises network to Azure**.

Two main options:
- **Azure VPN Gateway** 
- **Azure ExpressRoute** 

And under VPN Gateway, two common scenarios:
- **Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN**
- **Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN**

Let’s break them all down simply.

#### What is Azure VPN Gateway?

Azure VPN Gateway is a **managed network gateway** in Azure. It lets you:
- Connect **your on-premises data center to Azure**
- Use encrypted tunnels over the internet (IPsec/IKE)

It’s **cost-effective** and works for many hybrid scenarios.



#### Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN

This is for **permanent connection** between your on-premises router/firewall and Azure.

#### When to use:
- You have a physical office or datacenter
- Want all internal IPs to talk over private secure tunnel
- Already have VPN appliances like Cisco, FortiGate, Palo Alto

#### Typical Diagram:

#### Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN

This is for **individual devices or users** to connect securely to Azure resources.

#### When to use:
- Developers or remote workers need access to VMs in Azure
- You don’t have a hardware firewall/router
- You want a simple "dial-in VPN" option

You install a client on your PC, authenticate, and securely connect to the VNet.

#### What is ExpressRoute?

ExpressRoute is a **dedicated private connection** between your on-premises and Azure.

#### Benefits:
- Doesn’t go over public internet
- Super-fast, low latency, more reliable
- Used for enterprise-grade workloads (databases, backups, SAP, etc.)

But:
-  More expensive
- Requires a telco/provider partnership (e.g., Equinix, Airtel, AT&T)
