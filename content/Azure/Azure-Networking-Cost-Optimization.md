#### Azure Networking Cost Optimization & Monitoring

Azure networking is powerful — but can get expensive if you’re not careful.  
This post covers:

-  What costs the most in Azure networking?
-  How to reduce cost without compromising security
-  Tools to monitor and alert for network health



#### What Costs the Most?

| Resource             | Cost Impact                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Azure Firewall**   | $$$ — Pay per deployment + GB used |
| **ExpressRoute**     | $$$ — Monthly base + bandwidth     |
| **Data Transfer**    | Charges for traffic between regions or zones |
| **VPN Gateway**      | Based on SKU and time              |
| **Peering**          | Inbound = Free, Outbound = $$$     |
| **Public IP**        | Basic = Free, Standard = Billable  |

#### Cost Optimization Tips

#### Use NAT Gateway Instead of Load Balancer SNAT

- Avoid port exhaustion
- More scalable for outbound traffic
- Predictable IP and cost

#### Consolidate Firewalls in Hub

- One Azure Firewall in the **Hub VNet**
- Route all traffic through it
- Use UDRs and ASGs to enforce control

#### Avoid Cross-Region Traffic

- Peering across regions = **paid outbound**
- Keep apps and databases in **same region** when possible

#### Use Azure Cost Management

- Enable **tags** on VNet, Firewall, NAT Gateway
- Group by project/team/app
- Set up **budgets and alerts**



#### Monitoring Tools

| Tool                   | Use For                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Network Watcher**    | Packet capture, NSG flow logs      |
| **Azure Monitor**      | Metrics for Firewall, VPN, Gateway |
| **Log Analytics**      | Query NSG and Firewall logs        |
| **Connection Monitor** | End-to-end checks (latency, loss)  |



#### Monitor These Metrics

- Firewall throughput
- NAT Gateway SNAT ports used
- VPN Tunnel status (S2S, P2S)
- Inbound/outbound bytes per VNet
- Number of dropped packets (NSG)



#### Set Alerts (Examples)

- Alert if VPN Gateway is **down**
- Alert if Azure Firewall hits **80% throughput**
- Alert on **unexpected data transfer spikes**



#### Final Tip

- Secure, scalable Azure networking is **possible without breaking the bank**.  
But it requires:

- Planning IP space
- Designing with hub-spoke
- Monitoring everything!
