## Welcome to kasdevTech — Your Cloud Learning Hub 🚀

In today’s world, **cloud computing** is no longer optional — it is **essential** for businesses, developers, and architects.

But many beginners feel lost:  
👉 _Where do I start?_  
👉 _Which services should I learn first?_  
👉 _How can I gain practical experience?_

In this post, I will share a **step-by-step practical guide** to help you start your **cloud journey** in 2025 — based on my own experience as a cloud engineer working on Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, and cloud-native technologies.

## 1️⃣ Understand Cloud Basics

Before diving into Azure or AWS, understand what Cloud Computing is:

- **On-Demand Resources:** Pay for what you use (compute, storage, networking)
- **Elastic Scaling:** Scale up/down based on demand
- **Global Reach:** Deploy apps across global data centers
- **Service Models:** IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

---

## 2️⃣ Choose Your Cloud Platform

For many developers and architects, **Microsoft Azure** is an excellent choice:

- Deep enterprise support  
- Hybrid cloud and on-premises integrations  
- Great support for .NET Core, Java, Python, Node.js  
- Powerful AI + Data tools (Azure AI, OpenAI, Synapse)  
- Kubernetes (AKS) and serverless (Azure Functions)
