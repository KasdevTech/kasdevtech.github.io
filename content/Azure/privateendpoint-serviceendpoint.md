#### Azure Private Endpoint vs Service Endpoint

So you created a Storage Account, SQL Database, or Key Vault â€” and now youâ€™re wonderingâ€¦

Should I use a **Service Endpoint** or a **Private Endpoint**?

These two features are critical for **securing Azure PaaS services**. But theyâ€™re not the same.  
Letâ€™s break them down clearly with real-world context.

#### What is a Service Endpoint?

Service Endpoints **extend your VNetâ€™s private IP** to Azure PaaS services.

#### What it does:
- Allows you to **access Azure services over Azure backbone**
- **Still uses the public IP** of the service
- Improves security by **restricting access to your VNet only**

#### Example Use Case:
```
10.0.1.4 (VM in subnet) --> Storage Account
If Service Endpoint is enabled for "Microsoft.Storage", your subnet can talk to it â€” even though the storage has a public IP.
```

#### What is a Private Endpoint?
A Private Endpoint creates a private IP in your VNet that maps to an Azure resource.

What it does:
Fully private IP communication (no public IP usage)
Appears like the resource is inside your own VNet
Uses Private Link behind the scenes

#### Example Use Case:
```
10.0.1.4 (VM) --> 10.0.1.5 (Private Endpoint IP for SQL)
Even DNS will resolve to a private IP. Itâ€™s like having your SQL Database or Key Vault inside your own network.
```

#### Comparison Table
Feature	                Service Endpoint	                Private Endpoint
IP Type     	        Public IP of service	            Private IP in your VNet
Uses Azure Backbone  	Yes	                                Yes
Private DNS         	No	                                Yes (with Private DNS zone)
Security Scope	        Subnet Level	                    NIC Level (granular)
Access Model	        Extended access to Azure PaaS	    Private IP connectivity
Supported Services	    Many (Storage, SQL, KeyVault)	    Many, growing list

#### When to Use What?
Scenario	                            Recommended Choice
Quick and simple access control	        Service Endpoint
High security / no public exposure	    Private Endpoint
Need full DNS privacy	                Private Endpoint
You manage multiple services	        Private Endpoint

#### Real-World Tip
If you're working in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, etc.), Private Endpoints are preferred to meet compliance needs (no public IP traffic).
